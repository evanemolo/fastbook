## Defining average and instantaneous rates of change at a point

`change in y / change in x`

instantaneous rate of change at a point in a curve. this is the _derivative_. `d` is reserved for derivative.

`dy / dx` => instantaneous slope

`limit -> 0` we can't use 0 because...you can't divide by 0.
